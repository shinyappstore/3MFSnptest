#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/3MFSnptest](https://shinyappstore.com/a/3MFSnptest)__

3MFSnptest, an integral component of the MEPHAS suite, is tailored for in-depth exploration and analysis of non-parametric tests of means. MEPHAS, an open-source and free web-interactive, supports statistical data analyses for medical and pharmaceutical researchers. 3MFSnptest features an interface with distinct tabs for analyzing various distributions. Users can seamlessly execute non-parametric tests, such as Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test, for both one sample and two independent or paired samples. 3MFSnptest assists users in determining the statistical significance of medians and locations within their datasets, offering insights into basic descriptive statistics and providing visualization tools like box plots, distribution histograms, and density distribution plots. The application serves as a comprehensive tool for researchers exploring non-parametric means in their data analysis endeavors. Original publication: BMC Bioinformatics. 2020 May 11;21(1):183.
